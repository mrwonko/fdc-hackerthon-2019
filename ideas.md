# How to choose the next move

- aim to have a production composition that beats the enemy
- if you can't save a planet, abandon it
- only attack a planet if you can hold it(?)
- the value of production decreases over time, compared to the value of ships. Weigh with number of remaining rounds?
- minimise enemy fleet size/planets/production
